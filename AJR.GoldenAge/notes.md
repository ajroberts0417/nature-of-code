1. **Initial Conditions:**
- N0: 1 (Initial number of Golden Agers (LITERALLY JUST YOU))
- K: 8B (Carrying capacity - 8 billion people, the population of Earth)
- r: 1 (Growth rate - each Golden Ager supports just 1 new Golden Ager per year)


2. **It's Just Math**

	**people are seriously bad at doing the math here.**

	let's say you can create the circumstances for one (1) person to spend their life helping people per year.

	by spending their time helping people, they do the same. Now you have logistic (viral) growth. 

	If you're working on a 50 year time horizon, it only takes 27 years for basically the entire world to enter a Golden Age. You can do this in half a lifetime.

	Make the simulation more complex if you'd like -- but culture DOES scale exponentially, not linearly, so consider that the long-term growth will always be powerful.
